Senior year I took "AP JAVA" with Mr. Kerrigan 


We didnt have a computer lab, so I don't have much to show from the code, as it was all on my old laptop (which my mom has somewhere)

What *is* in this folder, is some files from my senior project (which was sweet as we got to take a month off from school and hang out in our basement and write code)
