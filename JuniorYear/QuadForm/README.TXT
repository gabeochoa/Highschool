PROJECT TITLE:  Solving Quadratic Equations

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
                    Part I: 
                     This project will allow a user to solve quadratic equations. 
                     Users will input the a,b, and c values from their equation
                     in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.  This program will then use
                     the quadratic formula to get the roots of the equations.
                     
                    Part II: 
                    Add a loop so that the user can choose how many
                    equations they would like to solve. (Or let them solve
                    equations until they choose to choose to quit.)
                    
                    Part III:
                    Add an error message if the roots to the equation entered 
                    are imaginary. (negative under the radical)
                    
                    Part IV: (Extra Credit)
                    Output imaginary roots in a + bi form.
