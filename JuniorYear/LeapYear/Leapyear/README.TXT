PROJECT TITLE: LeapYear

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
Design and implement an application that reads an 
integer valuerepresenting a year input by the user. 
The purpose of the program is to determine if the
year that was inputted is a leap year in the 
Gregorian calender.  A year is a leap year if
it is divisible by 4, unless it is divisible by
a 100 but not 400.

example 
2007 - not leap year, 2008 - is a leap year
1900 - not a leap year (divisible by 100)
2000 - is a leap year (divisible by 100, but also by 400)
        
        
Produce an error message for any input less than 1582 (the year the Gregorian
calender was adopted).        

VERSION or DATE:  DUE DATE: September 26, 2007


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:

 - The % operator returns the remainder
 so:
         14 % 4 = 2
         27 % 6 = 3
         30 % 5 = 0
